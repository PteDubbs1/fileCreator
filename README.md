Welcome to the File Creator github Page! There are a few installation steps to go through before you will be able to use this program.


Steps:
1) Download the .zip file from the page
2) Unzip and move the folder into your /home directory
3) type cd fileCreator && python3 fileCreator.py into a terminal to start the program

Notes:
Every time you want to start the program you will need to type the command that is shown in step 3 into a terminal, this will start the program, if you have any issues with the program or want to help out go to the issues tab and start a new issue. I will be trying to fix all bugs and add in any new file suggestions or any other suggestions that I can. Thank you for your interest!
